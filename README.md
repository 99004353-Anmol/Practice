| Past |  problem-oriented medical record (POMR) (1).  Clinicians now had access to a patientâ€™s entire medical history and the system allowed third-party facilities to verify diagnoses |
| Present | Dragon Systems developed a voice recognition prototype,  they were used more for billing and scheduling rather than electronic medical records.|
| Future | Master Patient Index (MPI) was introduced in the 1980s to keep track of patients and their medical data. This paved the way for the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC)|
